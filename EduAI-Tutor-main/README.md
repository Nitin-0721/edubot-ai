# 🎓 EduAI – AI-Powered Learning Assistant

🚀 Live Demo: https://eduai-tutor.streamlit.app/

EduAI is an **AI-powered learning assistant** built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **FAISS**, and **OpenAI models**.  
It helps students learn more effectively by allowing them to upload study materials (PDFs) and then:

- Ask questions based on the content
- Generate structured study notes
- Create practice MCQs
- Maintain learning sessions with persistent memory

EduAI uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ensure answers are grounded in the uploaded documents.

## 🔐 Configuration

### OpenAI API Key

EduAI requires an OpenAI API key.

#### Option 1: Environment Variable
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

#### Option 2: Streamlit Secrets

## 🧠 Building the Vector Store

Before asking questions or generating content, upload PDFs and process them inside the app.

Internally, EduAI:
- Splits documents into chunks
- Creates embeddings using OpenAI
- Stores vectors locally using FAISS

The index is saved in `faiss_index_local/`.

## 🚀 Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧩 Application Pages

## 🗄️ Database Design

EduAI uses SQLite to store:

- Chat conversations
- Application state
- Uploaded document metadata
- Generated notes and MCQs
- Session information

Each session maintains its own learning context.
